SLACK TODOS APP

Application requirements (tested with):
- Python 3.6.6 (add'l module required: requests)
- MySQL Server 5.6.34
- Apache with FastCGI (whatever my shared host happened to be running)

The application consists of the following 4 files:

- todos.py
- todoslib.py
- complete.py
- dbinit.sql

To set up the environment:

- Edit the python path in each *.py file if necessary (points to
  whatever python is found first in the runtime environment by
  default)
- Edit the database configuration at the beginning of todoslib.py
- Initialize the database configuration by sourcing dbinit.sql
